0MERN Car Auto Consult — Company-level Roadmap

> A full planning roadmap for a professional MERN-stack webapp: Auto Consult — buy/sell used cars, apply for loans, buy insurance, manage documents, and admin dashboard.




---

1. Project Summary

Name: Auto Consult (working)

Vision: A modern, secure, and scalable marketplace + services platform where users can list cars for sale, buy trusted used cars, apply for auto loans, and purchase car insurance — with an enterprise-grade admin dashboard to manage inventory, documents, customers, loans and policies.

Key personas:

Seller (private or dealer)

Buyer

Loan applicant

Insurance buyer

Admin (customer support, operations)

Super-admin / DevOps



---

2. Goals & Success Criteria

MVP delivered: core flows for listing, browsing, buying, loan application, and admin CRUD.

Secure: authentication, role-based access, file/document protection.

Stable & Scalable: stateless backend, horizontal scaling, CDN for assets.

Fast UX: responsive, mobile-first UI, lazy loading, pagination.

Operational: logging, monitoring, backups, automated deployments.


KPIs: daily active users, listings created/week, loans submitted, conversion rate, SLA for API Uptime.


---

3. High-level Architecture

Frontend: React (TypeScript) + Vite or Next.js (if SSR/SEO required). Tailwind CSS and component system (shadcn/ui or Radix + Headless UI).

Backend: Node.js + Express (TypeScript) or NestJS for enterprise structure.

DB: MongoDB (Atlas) + Redis (sessions, caching, rate-limiting)

File storage: AWS S3 (images, documents) with signed uploads.

Search: MongoDB text indexing + optional ElasticSearch for advanced search/filter.

Auth & Payments: JWT + refresh tokens, third-party payments (Stripe/PayPal/Razorpay), SMS/Email providers (Twilio / Amazon SES).

Other services: Background jobs (Bull / BullMQ + Redis), cron jobs, monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana or third-party like Datadog), error tracking (Sentry).



---

---

10. Company-level Files & Folders Structure

Below are recommended structures for frontend and backend along with brief notes. Use TypeScript for both for maintainability.

Frontend (React + Vite) — frontend/

frontend/
├─ public/
│  └─ robots.txt, favicon.ico
├─ src/
│  ├─ assets/                 # images, fonts
│  ├─ components/             # reusable UI components
│  │  ├─ ui/                  # design-system primitives (Button, Modal)
│  │  └─ listing/             # listing-specific components (Gallery, Specs)
│  ├─ features/               # feature folders (ducks)
│  │  ├─ auth/                # pages, hooks, api services
│  │  ├─ listings/
│  │  └─ loans/
│  ├─ hooks/                  # custom hooks (useAuth, useDebounce)
│  ├─ libs/                   # api clients, validators, helpers
│  ├─ pages/                  # route pages (Next.js style) or views
│  │  ├─ Home.tsx
│  │  ├─ Listing/[id].tsx
│  │  └─ Dashboard/
│  ├─ providers/              # context providers (AuthProvider)
│  ├─ routes/                 # route definitions
│  ├─ services/               # API calls (axios instances)
│  ├─ store/                  # Redux / Zustand / recoil
│  ├─ styles/                 # global styles, tailwind config
│  ├─ utils/                  # small helpers
│  ├─ App.tsx
│  └─ main.tsx
├─ .env.local
├─ package.json
└─ tsconfig.json

Notes:

Keep components/ui tiny and generic. Feature-specific components go into features/.

Use feature folders to encapsulate logic, tests, and styles.


Backend (Node.js + Express/NestJS) — backend/

backend/
├─ src/
│  ├─ api/
│  │  ├─ auth/
│  │  │  ├─ auth.controller.ts
│  │  │  ├─ auth.service.ts
│  │  │  └─ auth.routes.ts
│  │  └─ listings/
│  ├─ config/                 # configuration loader (env, feature flags)
│  ├─ controllers/
│  ├─ services/                # business logic
│  ├─ models/                  # mongoose schemas
│  ├─ repositories/            # DB access layer
│  ├─ middlewares/             # auth, rate-limit, error handler
│  ├─ jobs/                    # background jobs (BullMQ processors)
│  ├─ utils/
│  ├─ loaders/                 # db init, cache init
│  ├─ app.ts                   # express app
│  └─ server.ts                # start server
├─ tests/                      # unit & integration tests
├─ docker/                     # dockerfiles, compose
├─ .env
├─ package.json
└─ tsconfig.json

Notes:

Use a layered architecture: controllers -> services -> repositories.

Keep controllers thin (validation + calling service).

Prefer dependency injection (NestJS or manual with inversify) for testability.


Infra / DevOps — infra/ (in root repo)

infra/
├─ docker-compose.yml
├─ k8s/                       # kubernetes manifests (if using k8s)
├─ terraform/                 # IaC to provision infra
├─ ci/                        # CI pipelines (github actions templates)
└─ docs/

Monorepo Option (recommended for company-level):

repo-root/
├─ apps/
│  ├─ frontend/
│  └─ backend/
├─ packages/
│  ├─ ui/                     # shared UI components
│  ├─ libs/                   # shared JS libs: api clients, types
│  └─ types/                  # shared TypeScript types
├─ infra/
└─ package.json               # workspace scripts

Use Turborepo / pnpm workspaces for efficiency.


---

11. Best Practices & Conventions

TypeScript everywhere with strict settings

Commit messages: Conventional Commits

Branching: main, develop, feature branches feature/xxx

PR reviews: require 1–2 reviewers, automated tests

Linters & formatters: ESLint + Prettier + Husky pre-commit hooks

CI: run tests, lint, build, and run security scans on PRs

Secrets: store in secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, GitHub Secrets)



---

12. Testing Strategy

Unit tests (Jest) for services and utils

React Testing Library for components

Integration tests (Supertest) for API routes

E2E tests (Cypress) for critical user flows: listing creation, buy flow, loan submission



---

13. Deployment & Scalability

Dockerize services; use ECS/Fargate, Kubernetes, or managed platforms (Render/Heroku) for faster setup

Use load balancer (ALB), autoscaling groups, and CDN (CloudFront)

Horizontal scale stateless API servers; state in MongoDB/Redis

Use queue workers (BullMQ) for sending emails, processing docs, generating reports



---

14. Monitoring & Observability

Error tracking: Sentry

Logs: structured JSON logs to CloudWatch / ELK

Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana or Cloud provider metrics

Health checks & alerts (PagerDuty / Opsgenie)



---

15. Compliance & Legal

Data retention policy, user consent (GDPR/India IT rules)

Audit logs for document approvals

KYC compliance if required for loans



---

16. Timeline & Milestones (suggested)

Phase 0 — Planning (1–2 weeks)

Requirements, wireframes, ERD, API contract


Phase 1 — MVP (6–10 weeks)

Auth, listing creation & browsing, file upload, admin CRUD, loan form

Basic CI/CD pipeline, Docker


Phase 2 — Beta (4–6 weeks)

Payments integration, loan provider integration, insurance purchase flow

Improve search and filters, analytics


Phase 3 — Production & Scaling (ongoing)

Monitoring, backups, SSO, performance tuning

Dealer portal, valuation, optional mobile app


Adjust timings for team size.


---

17. Checklist before Launch

[ ] Security audit & pen-test

[ ] GDPR/privacy policy + terms

[ ] Backups & disaster recovery plan

[ ] Payment provider live keys

[ ] Logging & alerting enabled

[ ] E2E tests passing

18. Next Steps I Can Do for You (choose any)

1. Generate a full repo scaffold (monorepo) with starter code for frontend/backend (TypeScript).


2. Create detailed DB schema + sample Mongoose models.


3. Produce API contract (OpenAPI/Swagger).


4. Produce example UI pages (React components + Tailwind).


5. Create CI/CD GitHub Actions templates and Dockerfiles.



Tell me which item you want first and I'll scaffold it.
