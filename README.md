MERN Car Auto Consult — Company-level Roadmap

> A full planning roadmap for a professional MERN-stack webapp: Auto Consult — buy/sell used cars, apply for loans, buy insurance, manage documents, and admin dashboard.




---

1. Project Summary

Name: Auto Consult (working)

Vision: A modern, secure, and scalable marketplace + services platform where users can list cars for sale, buy trusted used cars, apply for auto loans, and purchase car insurance — with an enterprise-grade admin dashboard to manage inventory, documents, customers, loans and policies.

Key personas:

Seller (private or dealer)

Buyer

Loan applicant

Insurance buyer

Admin (customer support, operations)

Super-admin / DevOps



---

2. Goals & Success Criteria

MVP delivered: core flows for listing, browsing, buying, loan application, and admin CRUD.

Secure: authentication, role-based access, file/document protection.

Stable & Scalable: stateless backend, horizontal scaling, CDN for assets.

Fast UX: responsive, mobile-first UI, lazy loading, pagination.

Operational: logging, monitoring, backups, automated deployments.


KPIs: daily active users, listings created/week, loans submitted, conversion rate, SLA for API Uptime.


---

3. High-level Architecture

Frontend: React (TypeScript) + Vite or Next.js (if SSR/SEO required). Tailwind CSS and component system (shadcn/ui or Radix + Headless UI).

Backend: Node.js + Express (TypeScript) or NestJS for enterprise structure.

DB: MongoDB (Atlas) + Redis (sessions, caching, rate-limiting)

File storage: AWS S3 (images, documents) with signed uploads.

Search: MongoDB text indexing + optional ElasticSearch for advanced search/filter.

Auth & Payments: JWT + refresh tokens, third-party payments (Stripe/PayPal/Razorpay), SMS/Email providers (Twilio / Amazon SES).

Other services: Background jobs (Bull / BullMQ + Redis), cron jobs, monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana or third-party like Datadog), error tracking (Sentry).



---

4. MVP Feature List

User-facing:

Sign up / Login (email, phone OTP)

Seller flow: Create listing (photos, kms, year, documents), preview, publish

Buyer flow: Browse/search/filter, detailed listing page, contact seller

Offers / Negotiation (basic messaging or contact form)

Apply for loan (form submission + upload docs)

Buy insurance (policy purchase workflow)

Upload & manage documents (ID, RC book, insurance papers)

Profile & dashboard (my listings, my saves, applications)


Admin-facing:

Admin login & RBAC

Manage users, listings, documents, loans, policies

Approve/Reject listings and documents

Customer support ticket view & reply

Reports & analytics (sales, listing stats, loans)



---

5. Nice-to-have (Phase 2+)

Dealers portal (bulk uploads, inventory sync)

Automated vehicle valuation (price estimate using ML or rule engine)

Integration with KYC providers and vehicle history services

Loan provider integrations for instant approvals

Insurance aggregator APIs

Chatbot for lead capture

Multi-language support (i18n)

---

6. Data Models (brief)

User: id, name, email, phone, role, KYCStatus, createdAt

CarListing: id, ownerId, title, make, model, year, kms, price, status, photos[], documents[], createdAt

Offer / Inquiry: id, listingId, buyerId, message, amount, status

LoanApplication: id, userId, listingId (optional), status, lenderResponse, documents[], amountRequested

InsurancePolicy: id, userId, carId, provider, policyNumber, premium, startDate, endDate

Document: _id, userId, type, s3Key, verifiedBy, verifiedAt

AdminAction / AuditLog: track changes for compliance


(Design ERD as next step)


---

7. REST API Endpoints (selected)

POST /api/auth/register — register

POST /api/auth/login — login (JWT)

POST /api/auth/otp — phone OTP login

GET /api/listings — list, filters, pagination

Use OpenAPI (Swagger) for docs.


---

8. Auth & Security

JWT with short expiry + Refresh tokens stored in DB/Redis

Password hashing: bcrypt/argon2

Rate limiting & IP blocking (express-rate-limit behind a proxy)

Input validation: Joi / Zod on all endpoints

CORS, helmet (security headers)

Signed S3 uploads & content-type checks

RBAC: roles = [user, seller, dealer, support, admin, superadmin]

File virus scanning (optional) for uploaded docs

PCI compliance if handling payments (use Stripe to minimize scope)



---

9. Frontend: UX & Design System

Design system: Tailwind CSS + component primitives (Buttons, Inputs, Modals, Cards, Tables)

Accessibility (a11y) checks

Responsive: mobile-first

Image gallery & lightbox for listing photos

Optimistic UI for actions like submitting offers

Offline resilience for forms (localStorage)


UI Libraries suggestions: Tailwind CSS, Headless UI, shadcn/ui, Lucide/Feather icons.


---

10. Company-level Files & Folders Structure

Below are recommended structures for frontend and backend along with brief notes. Use TypeScript for both for maintainability.

Frontend (React + Vite) — frontend/

frontend/
├─ public/
│  └─ robots.txt, favicon.ico
├─ src/
│  ├─ assets/                 # images, fonts
│  ├─ components/             # reusable UI components
│  │  ├─ ui/                  # design-system primitives (Button, Modal)
│  │  └─ listing/             # listing-specific components (Gallery, Specs)
│  ├─ features/               # feature folders (ducks)
│  │  ├─ auth/                # pages, hooks, api services
│  │  ├─ listings/
│  │  └─ loans/
│  ├─ hooks/                  # custom hooks (useAuth, useDebounce)
│  ├─ libs/                   # api clients, validators, helpers
│  ├─ pages/                  # route pages (Next.js style) or views
│  │  ├─ Home.tsx
│  │  ├─ Listing/[id].tsx
│  │  └─ Dashboard/
│  ├─ providers/              # context providers (AuthProvider)
│  ├─ routes/                 # route definitions
│  ├─ services/               # API calls (axios instances)
│  ├─ store/                  # Redux / Zustand / recoil
│  ├─ styles/                 # global styles, tailwind config
│  ├─ utils/                  # small helpers
│  ├─ App.tsx
│  └─ main.tsx
├─ .env.local
├─ package.json
└─ tsconfig.json

Notes:

Keep components/ui tiny and generic. Feature-specific components go into features/.

Use feature folders to encapsulate logic, tests, and styles.


Backend (Node.js + Express/NestJS) — backend/

backend/
├─ src/
│  ├─ api/
│  │  ├─ auth/
│  │  │  ├─ auth.controller.ts
│  │  │  ├─ auth.service.ts
│  │  │  └─ auth.routes.ts
│  │  └─ listings/
│  ├─ config/                 # configuration loader (env, feature flags)
│  ├─ controllers/
│  ├─ services/                # business logic
│  ├─ models/                  # mongoose schemas
│  ├─ repositories/            # DB access layer
│  ├─ middlewares/             # auth, rate-limit, error handler
│  ├─ jobs/                    # background jobs (BullMQ processors)
│  ├─ utils/
│  ├─ loaders/                 # db init, cache init
│  ├─ app.ts                   # express app
│  └─ server.ts                # start server
├─ tests/                      # unit & integration tests
├─ docker/                     # dockerfiles, compose
├─ .env
├─ package.json
└─ tsconfig.json

Notes:

Use a layered architecture: controllers -> services -> repositories.

Keep controllers thin (validation + calling service).

Prefer dependency injection (NestJS or manual with inversify) for testability.


Infra / DevOps — infra/ (in root repo)

infra/
├─ docker-compose.yml
├─ k8s/                       # kubernetes manifests (if using k8s)
├─ terraform/                 # IaC to provision infra
├─ ci/                        # CI pipelines (github actions templates)
└─ docs/

Monorepo Option (recommended for company-level):

repo-root/
├─ apps/
│  ├─ frontend/
│  └─ backend/
├─ packages/
│  ├─ ui/                     # shared UI components
│  ├─ libs/                   # shared JS libs: api clients, types
│  └─ types/                  # shared TypeScript types
├─ infra/
└─ package.json               # workspace scripts

Use Turborepo / pnpm workspaces for efficiency.

11. Best Practices & Conventions

TypeScript everywhere with strict settings

Commit messages: Conventional Commits

Branching: main, develop, feature branches feature/xxx

PR reviews: require 1–2 reviewers, automated tests

Linters & formatters: ESLint + Prettier + Husky pre-commit hooks

CI: run tests, lint, build, and run security scans on PRs

Secrets: store in secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, GitHub Secrets)



---

12. Testing Strategy

Unit tests (Jest) for services and utils

React Testing Library for components

Integration tests (Supertest) for API routes

E2E tests (Cypress) for critical user flows: listing creation, buy flow, loan submission



---

13. Deployment & Scalability

Dockerize services; use ECS/Fargate, Kubernetes, or managed platforms (Render/Heroku) for faster setup

Use load balancer (ALB), autoscaling groups, and CDN (CloudFront)

Horizontal scale stateless API servers; state in MongoDB/Redis

Use queue workers (BullMQ) for sending emails, processing docs, generating reports



---

14. Monitoring & Observability

Error tracking: Sentry

Logs: structured JSON logs to CloudWatch / ELK

Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana or Cloud provider metrics

Health checks & alerts (PagerDuty / Opsgenie)



---

15. Compliance & Legal

Data retention policy, user consent (GDPR/India IT rules)

Audit logs for document approvals

KYC compliance if required for loans



---

16. Timeline & Milestones (suggested)

Phase 0 — Planning (1–2 weeks)

Requirements, wireframes, ERD, API contract


Phase 1 — MVP (6–10 weeks)

Auth, listing creation & browsing, file upload, admin CRUD, loan form

Basic CI/CD pipeline, Docker


Phase 2 — Beta (4–6 weeks)

Payments integration, loan provider integration, insurance purchase flow

Improve search and filters, analytics


Phase 3 — Production & Scaling (ongoing)

Monitoring, backups, SSO, performance tuning

Dealer portal, valuation, optional mobile app


Adjust timings for team size.

18. Next Steps I Can Do for You (choose any)

1. Generate a full repo scaffold (monorepo) with starter code for frontend/backend (TypeScript).


2. Create detailed DB schema + sample Mongoose models.


3. Produce API contract (OpenAPI/Swagger).


4. Produce example UI pages (React components + Tailwind).


5. Create CI/CD GitHub Actions templates and Dockerfiles.



Tell me which item you want first and I'll scaffold it.

## Implementation Plan

Based on the roadmap, we'll start by generating a full repo scaffold (monorepo) with starter code for frontend/backend (TypeScript).

### Monorepo Structure
```
auto-consult/
├─ apps/
│  ├─ frontend/              # React + Vite + TypeScript
│  └─ backend/               # Node.js + Express + TypeScript
├─ packages/
│  ├─ ui/                    # Shared UI components
│  ├─ libs/                  # Shared JS libs: api clients, types
│  └─ types/                 # Shared TypeScript types
├─ infra/                   # Infrastructure files
└─ package.json             # Workspace configuration
```

### Next Steps
1. Switch to Code mode to create the monorepo structure
2. Set up frontend application with React + Vite + TypeScript
3. Set up backend application with Node.js + Express + TypeScript
4. Create shared packages for UI components, libraries, and types
5. Configure infrastructure files (docker, CI/CD)
